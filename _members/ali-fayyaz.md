Ali was a first-year graduate student in Biophysics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He studied physics as an undergraduate, where he developed an interest in computational biophysics and worked on applying reinforcement learning to a model of a microswimmer in low-Reynolds-number environments. Drawn to computational neuroscience, he joined the INSPIRE Lab as a PhD rotational student from February to April 2025. Outside of academics, Ali enjoys music, movies, and exploring new places.
