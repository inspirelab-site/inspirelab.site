Ali is a first-year graduate student in Biophysics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He studied physics in undergrad, during which time he pivoted toward computational biophysics and worked on applying reinforcement learning to a model of a microswimmer in low-Reylonds. He is interested in computational neuroscience and joined the INSPIRE Lab in Feb 2025. In his free time, he enjoys good music, movies, and exploring new places.
