Hi, I am Junhao Zhao, a PhD student in Inspire Lab. I received my BS degree in Tsinghua University in China and am pursing my PhD degree in University of Maryland, College Park. My major interest is human brain visual modeling and generative models. Recently, I am working on fMRI-to-video generation models, in which I am trying to reconstruct what people are watching  based on their brain signals.
