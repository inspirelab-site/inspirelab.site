Dr. Nan Xu is an incoming Assistant Professor (starting December 2024) in the [​Fischell Department of Bioengineering](https://bioe.umd.edu), [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://ece.umd.edu) and the [Neuroscience & Cognitive Science Program](https://nacs.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland, College Park. Nan directs Imaging- and Neuro-computations for Precision Informatics Research (INSPIRE) Lab. With a strong foundation in computational science, her research spans statistical and machine learning, applied mathematics, neuroscience, and various biomedical applications. Her current work focuses on developing advanced computational models and analyses of functional neuroimaging data to gain new insights into brain function, neurological diseases, and broader informatics applications.

Nan earned a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Rochester in 2011. She completed her M.Sc. (2015) and Ph.D. (2017) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, with minors in Applied Mathematics and Cognitive Neuroscience. Her interdisciplinary postdoctoral experience includes a fellowship in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech (2017-2018), a visiting scientist position at the McGovern Brain Institute at MIT (2022), and a postdoctoral fellowship in Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University (2019-2024). Her research is currently supported by the NIH BRAIN Initiative K99/R00 award.

    <p> Nan has a rich and diverse background in music, recognized as the National Outstanding Pianist in China (2006), winning first prizes at the Beijing Piano Music Festival (2004, 2006), and the University of Rochester's Concerto Competition (2009). She studied with Prof. Vincent Lenti at the Eastman School of Music (2007–2011), performed with the University of Rochester Symphony Orchestra and the Cornell University Wind Ensemble, while also hosting personal recitals and those with friends. Though preparing for recitals has become increasingly challenging, she still find joys in dabbling in music improvisation whenever she can. You can enjoy some of her performances on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgcuJSqEkYk">YouTube</a> and catch a few of her creations on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xu-nan-47854440">SoundCloud</a>!</p>
      
    <p> Nan is also passionate about travel and photography, as seen in her work on <a href="https://gurushots.com/xiaonan.nxu/photos">GuruShots</a> and her curated <a href="https://imnanxu.wixsite.com/west-coast-usa">U.S. moments</a>. She enjoys staying active with friends, having played as a winger on the University of Rochester women’s rugby team and co-founding the International Tennis Club at Cornell.</p>
