Postdoctoral researchers receive mentored experience in developing and running interdisciplinary research projects, writing grant, and mentoring students. We now have two postdoc openings starting in Jan 2025!

- **Position 1**: This position will focus on developing new machine/deep learning, information-theoretic & statistical approaches, and other computational methodologies for functional neuroimaging data. Candidates must have a PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering, (theoretical) Physics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field. Applicants with a strong quantitative background and a interest in brain science are encouraged to apply. For more information—including details on how to apply—download the [position flyer](/assets/hirings/hire2025_Postdoc_modeling.pdf).

- **Position 2**: This position involves developing novel analyses for functional neuroimaging data to gain new insights into the functional brain dynamic system. Candidates must have expertise in computational neuroscience (including data science, statistical analysis, and coding skills) and demonstrated experience in preprocessing and analyzing functional neuroimaging data (such as fMRI, EEG, or optical imaging data). Proficiency in tools and languages such as FSL, ANTs, AFNI, FreeSurfer, Python, and MATLAB is required. Applicants should hold a PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering, Biomedical/Bioengineering, Computational Neuroscience, or a related field. For more information—including details on how to apply—download the [position flyer](/assets/hirings/hire2025_Postdoc_analysis.pdf).

- **Preferred Dates for both positions**:
    - Application review: September – December 2024
