I am a first year Bioengineering PhD student at the University of Maryland rotating in the Inspire lab. My research interests include computational modeling, medical device development, and artificial intelligence. Specifically I would like to conduct research focused on treatments for cancer and neurological disorders. Outside of the lab I enjoy baking, running, and spending time with my friends and family!
