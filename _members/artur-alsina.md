I'm a Masterâ€™s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, currently in my final semester. My interests lie in computer architecture, machine learning, and more recently, network neuroscience. My current research focuses on analyzing differences in brain dynamics in patients with Post-Concussion
Vestibular Disorder. On my spare time I enjoy hiking, reading, and traveling across the U.S. with friends.
