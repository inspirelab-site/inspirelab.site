* **PhD Students**: We are seeking highly motivated PhD students to join us at INSPIRE Lab! Our research focuses on developing machine learning, statistical, and deep learning models for neuroimaging data. We’re looking for students with strong quantitative skills, coding experience, and a passion for computational brain science. If this sounds like you, please apply directly through the [BioE](https://bioe.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions), [ECE](https://ece.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions), or [NACS](https://nacs.umd.edu/students/application) PhD programs at UMD and mention our lab in your application. 

{% capture lorem %} PhD admissions at UMD are managed by departments, not individual labs. We can only discuss project details or communicate further once you’ve been admitted or formally invited through the admissions process. If this applies to you, please send your CV and transcript. Due to the high volume of inquiries, I will only respond to those who meet these criteria. {% endcapture %}

* **Master’s Students**: If you’ve been admitted to a data science-related master’s program at UMD and are interested in pursuing a thesis at INSPIRE Lab, feel free to reach out with your CV and transcript.
