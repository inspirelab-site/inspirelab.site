* **PhD Students**: We are seeking highly motivated PhD students to join us! At INSPIRE Lab, our PhD students engage in cutting-edge research, developing machine learning, statistical, and deep learning models for neuroimaging data. We’re looking for students with strong quantitative skills, coding experience, and a passion for computational brain science. If this sounds like you, please apply through the BioE, ECE, or NACS PhD programs at UMD and mention our lab in your application. **Note**: PhD admissions at UMD are managed by the graduate admissions committee of the respective department/program, not individual labs. You must be admitted to a relevant UMD program or invited through the formal application process before we can discuss specific projects. To get in touch, please send your CV and transcript. Due to the high volume of inquiries, I will only respond to students who have been admitted or formally invited.

* **Master’s Students**: If you’ve been admitted to a data science-related master’s program at UMD and are interested in pursuing a thesis at INSPIRE Lab, feel free to reach out with your CV and transcript.
