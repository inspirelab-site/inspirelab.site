We have multiple openings for students who have been admitted to UMD’s graduate programs! Please note that admissions are managed and decided by the department, not individual labs. If you meet the criteria below and are excited to join us, send me your CV and transcript. Due to the high volume of inquiries, I’ll respond only to those who have been admitted.

* **PhD students**: At INSPIRE Lab, our PhD students engage in cutting-edge research, with mentorship and guidance on independent projects. We work on developing machine learning/statistical/deep learning models and novel analyses for functional neuroimaging data.
    **Criteria**: We’re looking for students with a strong theoretical or quantitative background, coding skills, and a passion for computational brain science. If this sounds like you, your first step is to apply to the ECE, BioE, or NACS PhD programs at UMD, and mention your interest in our lab in your application. Once you receive admission, we might just get the chance to work together!

* **Master students**: If you’ve been admitted to a data science-related master’s program at UMD College Park and are interested in research or a thesis project at INSPIRE Lab, welcome to contact me!
