We are seeking highly motivated graduate students to join us at INSPIRE Lab! Our research is centered on advancing machine learning, statistical, and deep learning methods to analyze functional neuroimaging data. Current research directions include but not limited to:
  1. **Computational Brain Imaging & Brain Science**: Modeling functional brain networks using information theory, statistical inference, and network science.
  2. **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics**: Developing bio-inspired AI, AI models to predict therapy response, and statistical learning applications, etc.
  3. **Functional Brain Dynamics**: Applying statistical and machine learning techniques to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain through multimodal neuroimaging.

* **PhD Students**: We are currently recruiting Ph.D. students with solid mathematical and quantitative skills, coding experience, and a genuine interest in computational brain science. If this sounds like you, please apply directly through the [BioE](https://bioe.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions), [ECE](https://ece.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions), or [NACS](https://nacs.umd.edu/students/application) PhD programs at UMD, and mention my name and your areas of interest in your application.

{% capture lorem %} PhD admissions at UMD are managed by the respective departments rather than individual labs. We look forward to discussing specific projects and delving into details once you’ve been admitted or formally invited through the admissions process. If this applies to you, please feel free to send along your CV and transcript. Due to the high volume of inquiries, I’m only able to respond to applicants who meet these criteria. Good luck with your applications!{% endcapture %}

* **Master’s Students**: If you’ve been admitted to a data science-related master’s program at UMD and are interested in pursuing a thesis at INSPIRE Lab, feel free to reach out with your CV and transcript.
