We have several openings for graduate students who are already admitted to the University of Maryland (UMD). Due to the high volume of inquiries, I can only respond to those who have received admission. If you meet the criteria below and are interested, please email me your CV and transcript.
* **PhD students**: PhD students at INSPIRE Lab receive mentored research experience and guidance in conducting independent research. We encourage our PhD students to take data science courses to remain at the cutting edge of the field and apply their technical expertise to brain science research. Our projects involve developing machine learning, statistical, and deep learning models, as well as novel analyses for neuroimaging data.
    **Criteria**: We can only recruit students who have been admitted to one of UMD’s PhD programs, such as BioE, ECE, or NACS. PhD admissions decisions are made by the respective committees, not by individual labs. If you’re genuinely interested in joining us, please apply to the ECE, BioE, or NACS PhD programs at UMD and specify your lab interest in your statement.

* **Master students**: If you are admitted to any of the data science-related master's programs at UMD College Park and are interested in conducting research projects or a thesis in INSPIRE Lab, please contact me.
