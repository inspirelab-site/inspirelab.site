* **PhD Students**: We are seeking highly motivated PhD students to join us! At INSPIRE Lab, our PhD students engage in cutting-edge research, developing machine learning, statistical, and deep learning models for neuroimaging data. We’re looking for students with strong quantitative skills, coding experience, and a passion for computational brain science. If this sounds like you, please apply through the [BioE](https://bioe.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions), [ECE](https://ece.umd.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions), or [NACS](https://nacs.umd.edu/students/application) PhD programs at UMD and mention our lab in your application. 

**Note**: PhD admissions at UMD are managed by the respective department/program, not individual labs. Before we can discuss specific projects, you'll need to be admitted to a relevant UMD program or receive an invitation through the formal application process. To get in touch, please send your CV and transcript. Due to the high volume of inquiries, I will only respond to students who have been admitted or formally invited.

* **Master’s Students**: If you’ve been admitted to a data science-related master’s program at UMD and are interested in pursuing a thesis at INSPIRE Lab, feel free to reach out with your CV and transcript.
