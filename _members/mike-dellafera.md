Mike attended the University of Maryland, College Park for his undergraduate degrees in biology and psychology with a specialization in neuroscience. During this time, he worked in Dr. Andres De Los Reyes' C.A.I.P. lab studying stress levels and communication as it pertains to conflict resolution in a parent and their teen. After graduating in spring 2022, Mike worked for the FDA before getting back into the world of research. He joined Dr. Anna Li's lab as the lab manager studying the effects of oxycodone and methamphetamine on relapse behavior in rats. Currently he is serving as the lab manager for Dr. Xu's INSPIRE lab. Moving forward, Mike hopes to study long term memory using fMRI in graduate school. In his free time Mike enjoys reading, rock climbing, and handling his pet snakes!
