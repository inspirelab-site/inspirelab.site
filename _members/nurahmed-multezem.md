I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering at A. James Clark School of Engineering, University of Maryland. Currently, I am working on analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project. I am interested in bio-inspired applications of engineering and hope to explore how principles from neuroscience and biology can inform the design of intelligent systems and technologies that improve human health. In my spare time, I enjoy playing ping pong, going on long walks, hiking, and exploring new adventures.
