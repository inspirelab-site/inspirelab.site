Linnea earned a BSc in Biochemistry from the Georg August University GÃ¶ttingen and an MSc in Neuroscience from the University of Oxford. She went on to complete her PhD in Health Science at the University of Cologne, working to analyse and model fMRI data to study brain network dynamics in patients with psychiatric conditions. Her research interest lies in using computational analysis and modelling techniques on multimodal neuroimaging data to investigate the mechanisms shaping spatiotemporal patterns of brain connectivity and their disruption in brain disorders."
