Hello, my name is Olaniyi Oluwaniolami Salami, a junior currently studying Computer Science and Math at the University of Maryland. Outside of classes, I was born and raised in Baltimore County, Maryland, and in my free time enjoy gaming and game development, crocheting, and learning languages. I am studying the functional Brain Dynamics Biomarkers in Children with obesity. Super excited to work on this computational research and hope to truly make a difference.
