Undergraduate Computer Science student in the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at the University of Maryland. My focus and interest lie in the application of computer and data science to other interdisciplinary fields. Currently working on evaluating the consistency of spatiotemporal evolution of brain activity patterns in rodents and humans.
