Hi! My name is Nirmal, and I am an undergrad at the University of Maryland studying Computer Science and Math. I enjoy solving puzzles and want to use my knowledge of software engineering to tackle real-world problems. In my spare time, I am a passionate badminton player and enjoy hiking and other outdoor activities.
