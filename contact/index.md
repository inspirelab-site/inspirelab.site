#### Join the Exciting Journey at INSPIRE Lab!
At **I**maging- and **N**euro-computation**s** for **P**recision **I**nformatics **R**esearch (**INSPIRE**) Lab, we strive to unravel the complexities of brain function, neurological disorders, and biological processes through advanced modeling and analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. Our research focuses on pioneering machine learning, statistical, and deep learning methods to interpret data from cutting-edge imaging technologies. By joining our team, you will contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in brain science, informatics, and beyond. 

<!-- * Current Research Directions include but not limited to:
  1. **Computational Brain Imaging & Brain Science**  
   Modeling functional brain networks using techniques from information theory, graphical models, and network science.
  2. **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics**  
   Developing bio-inspired AI, predictive models for therapy response, statistical learning applications, and more.
  3. **Functional Brain Dynamics**  
   Applying statistical and machine learning approaches to examine the brain’s spatiotemporal dynamics through multimodal neuroimaging.
We are currently recruiting **postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students** to join our team! -->


#### Lab Core Values
At INSPIRE Lab, we strive to build an innovative, collaborative, and supportive research environment. These principles are central to our lab culture:
- **Pursue What Fulfills You**: Engage in work that genuinely fulfills you intellectually. Avoid limiting yourself to something narrowly defined. We value interdisciplinary research and encourage lowering barriers across disciplines. Maintain scientific rigor while staying open to thoughtful risks and “wild” ideas.
- **Follow Your Own Pace and Execute Steadily**: Everyone’s journey is unique, and real progress comes from steady, focused action. Move forward at your own rhythm, building upon each step. Your journey here is about discovering and maximizing your scientific potentials.
- **Ethics First**: Good science is built on strong ethical principles. Uphold the highest moral standards in both our research and personal conduct. This means honesty in data handling, integrity in reporting, and respect for all individuals involved. Embrace accountability by acknowledging and learning from prior mistakes. Let ethical considerations guide every decision, ensuring our contributions are responsible and trustworthy.
- **Collaborative Innovation**: Foster creativity by working with others, incorporating different approaches and methodologies to address complex challenges. Be open to frictions, learn from them, and value unique insights.
- **Stay Problem-Focused**: Keep the core problem at the forefront of your work. Tools and techniques are means to solve a challenge, not the goal itself. Let the problem guide your choice of methods, adapting as needed to find the best solutions.
- **Balance and Well-being**: Work in focused blocks, take breaks, and stay physically active. Balance not only enhances productivity but also boosts your overall well-being.

#### Why Choose Us?
INSPIRE Lab, part of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering within the A. James Clark School of Engineering, is located in A. James Clark Hall at the University of Maryland, College Park. Our lab is adjacent to advanced neuroimaging core facilities and equipped with high-performance computing resources. Besides the exciting research and resources, UMD's proximity to major government research institutions such as NIH, NSF, DOD, and FDA, as well as world-leading hospitals, presents extensive collaboration opportunities. Additionally, the campus is conveniently located near Washington D.C. and Baltimore, offering a variety of living and recreational options.
