#### Join the Exciting Journey at INSPIRE Lab!

At the **Imaging- and Neuro-computations for Precision Informatics Research (INSPIRE) Lab**, we strive to unravel the complexities of brain function, neurological disorders, and biological processes through advanced modeling and analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. Our research focuses on pioneering machine learning, statistical, and deep learning methods to interpret data from cutting-edge imaging technologies. By joining our team, you will contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in brain science, informatics, and beyond. 

<!-- * Current Research Directions include but not limited to:
  1. **Computational Brain Imaging & Brain Science**  
   Modeling functional brain networks using techniques from information theory, graphical models, and network science.
  2. **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics**  
   Developing bio-inspired AI, predictive models for therapy response, statistical learning applications, and more.
  3. **Functional Brain Dynamics**  
   Applying statistical and machine learning approaches to examine the brainâ€™s spatiotemporal dynamics through multimodal neuroimaging.
We are currently recruiting **postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students** to join our team! -->

#### Why Choose Us?
INSPIRE Lab, part of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering within the A. James Clark School of Engineering, is located in A. James Clark Hall at the University of Maryland, College Park. Our lab is adjacent to advanced neuroimaging core facilities and equipped with high-performance computing resources. Besides the exciting research and resources, UMD's proximity to major government research institutions such as NIH, NSF, DOD, and FDA, as well as world-leading hospitals, presents extensive collaboration opportunities. Additionally, the campus is conveniently located near Washington D.C. and Baltimore, offering a variety of living and recreational options.
