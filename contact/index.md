#### Join the Exciting Journey at INSPIRE Lab!
At **I**maging- and **N**euro-computation**s** for **P**recision **I**nformatics **R**esearch (**INSPIRE**) Lab, we strive to unravel the complexities of brain function, neurological disorders, and biological processes through advanced modeling and analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. Our research focuses on pioneering machine learning, statistical, and deep learning methods to interpret data from cutting-edge imaging technologies. By joining our team, you will contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in brain science, informatics, and beyond. 

<!-- * Current Research Directions include but not limited to:
  1. **Computational Brain Imaging & Brain Science**  
   Modeling functional brain networks using techniques from information theory, graphical models, and network science.
  2. **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics**  
   Developing bio-inspired AI, predictive models for therapy response, statistical learning applications, and more.
  3. **Functional Brain Dynamics**  
   Applying statistical and machine learning approaches to examine the brain’s spatiotemporal dynamics through multimodal neuroimaging.
We are currently recruiting **postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students** to join our team! -->


#### Our Core Values and Philosophies
At INSPIRE Lab, we uphold values that foster a supportive and innovative research environment. Together, we co-create our lab norms, values, and policies based on shared aspirations. These guiding philosophies, initially drafted by Nan, serve as a living document that we continually refine. We reflect on our actions—both individually and as a team—to ensure they align with the principles we value.
- **Pursue What Fulfills You**: Engage in work that genuinely fulfills you intellectually. Avoid limiting yourself to something narrowly defined. We value interdisciplinary research and encourage lowering the boundaries between disciplines, allowing for risk-taking and embracing "wild" ideas.
- **Follow Your Own Pace and Execute Steadily**: Everyone’s journey is unique, and real progress comes from steady, focused action. Move forward at your own rhythm, building upon each step. Consistent effort and resilience are key to uncovering your profound and meaningful potentials.
- **Ethics First**: Good science is built on strong ethical principles. Uphold the highest standards in both research and personal conduct, including honesty in data collection, processing, and analysis, integrity in reporting results, and respect for all individuals involved. Let ethical considerations guide each decision, ensuring your contributions are responsible and trustworthy.
- **Embrace Diversity**: Collaborate with individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, or methodologies. Diversity enriches perspectives and fosters creativity. Be open to frictions, learn from them, and value unique insights.
- **Stay Problem-Focused**: Keep the core problem at the forefront of your work. Tools and techniques are means to solve a challenge, not the goal itself. Let the problem guide your choice of methods, adapting as needed to find the best solutions.
- **Balance**: Avoid working 24/7; instead, create focused time blocks free from distractions, and take breaks to refresh. Physical activities, such as workouts or outdoor exercise, support mental health and help you stay productive.

#### Why Choose Us?
INSPIRE Lab, part of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering within the A. James Clark School of Engineering, is located in A. James Clark Hall at the University of Maryland, College Park. Our lab is adjacent to advanced neuroimaging core facilities and equipped with high-performance computing resources. Besides the exciting research and resources, UMD's proximity to major government research institutions such as NIH, NSF, DOD, and FDA, as well as world-leading hospitals, presents extensive collaboration opportunities. Additionally, the campus is conveniently located near Washington D.C. and Baltimore, offering a variety of living and recreational options.
