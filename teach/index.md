### Network Neuroscience & Brain Dynamic Analysis 
This course explores the emerging interdisciplinary field of network neuroscience, integrating concepts from neuroscience, systems engineering, data science, and neural engineering. Students will engage with both classical and modern mathematical models of network sciences, as well as advanced approaches for analyzing brain dynamics. In addition, they will develop skills in peer reviewing journal articles and writing reviewer reports. Students will gain hands-on experience in neuro data analysis by applying these models and analyses to functional neuroimaging datasets such as EEG, LFP, and/or fMRI. The course emphasizes building intuition for the types of problems in brain science that can be addressed through network-based approaches, while also fostering analytical skills and promoting interdisciplinary research through team projects.
