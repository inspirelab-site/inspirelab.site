### Network Neuroscience & Brain Dynamic Analysis 
This course explores the emerging interdisciplinary field of network neuroscience, integrating principles from neuroscience, systems engineering, data science, and neural engineering. Students will dive into both classical and modern mathematical models of network connectivity, along with novel approaches for analyzing brain dynamics. These models and analytical techniques will then be applied to functional neuroimaging data. The course features hands-on analysis of EEG, LFP, and/or fMRI data from open databases, with a strong emphasis on practical data handling, analytical skills, and collaborative research through interdisciplinary team projects.
